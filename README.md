# email designer/developer resources
My own collection of resources that helps me in day 2 day work with email design and developing. I will add new resources from time to time. At this moment I'm just starting to fill up this page with content.

## Email copy

**[Just Good Copy](http://www.goodemailcopy.com/)**

Good copy matters, but setting the right tone can be a challenge sometimes. For example, how do you best communicate that billing had failed, that a subscription is about to renew or that your product is under maintenance? Some companies manage to do this extremely well, and to give you a hand when writing email copy. [Just Good Copy](http://www.goodemailcopy.com/) has collected these outstanding examples.

The collection features email copy for all kinds of occasions: from welcome emails and new feature announcements to trickier things like apologies, billing issues and the unpleasant case of shutting down.

## Images
**[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)** good alternative for Photoshop, it's opening psd files and this is enough to crop email design. Images  can be saved only in two formats - jpg and png.

Available web app and desktop version, In my opinion desktop working much faster and available worktop is bigger.


**[Ribbet](https://www.ribbet.com/app)** as creators claim it's Photoshop alternative, that can be used inside your browser. At least it's good to slice provided email design in jpg, png or gif. As alternative for Photoshop it not support psd or pdf format. Some features available only for registered users.

There is available [Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ribbet-photo-editor/bikpkcdadljalhghbbipfkkhocppkhob).

No login or account required.

**[PlaceIt](https://placeit.net/)** makes it easy to create beautiful screenshots of your website, application or any other digital product.

You simply type in a URL, and PlaceIt automatically generates a screenshot and places it inside a device in a particular context, such as an iPad sitting on a desk or a MacBook Pro sitting on a park bench.
