# email designer/developer resources
My own collection of resources that helps me in day 2 day work with email design and developing. I will add new resources from time to time. At this moment I'm just starting to fill up this page with content.

## Images

**[PlaceIt](https://placeit.net/)** makes it easy to create beautiful screenshots of your website, application or any other digital product.

You simply type in a URL, and PlaceIt automatically generates a screenshot and places it inside a device in a particular context, such as an iPad sitting on a desk or a MacBook Pro sitting on a park bench.

**[Canva](https://www.canva.com/)** helps make graphic design simple. The tool contains thousands of beautiful stock images which can be used in your designs, and you can easily add other elements such as text, banners, frames, and buttons as well.
