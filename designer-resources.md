## Image editors

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
After creating first email designs I found it quite interesting tool. Will update this later after email designs need to be converted to HTML documents.

### [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
The free image editor is web-based and comes with a UI that is very similar to what youâ€™re used from Photoshop. Photopea supports layers, layer masks and blend modes, and offers a lot of the tools that you love from Photoshop: the Magic Wand, Lasso, and Clone Tool, for example. It can handle PSD, Gimp, and WebP files, as well as common image formats, of course. A nice alternative for quick edits.
